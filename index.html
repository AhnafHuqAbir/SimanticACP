        <p style="color: brown;">My School is the second-largest school in the entire city. Furthermore, it is among the
            most
            renowned institutions of
            the state. It has two very large fields. We call it the front and the backfield. On the front, we play
            sports like
            football and hockey because of itsâ€™ soft ground. However, the back is to play cricket. This is because it
            has a
            pitch on
            it and the ground was hard.

            Moreover, my school also has a basketball court where students practice almost every day. My favorite is the
            swimming
            pool which is quite big. So I never miss any swimming periods whenever I have any. Further my school has two
            halls.
            One
            is the new gymnasium and the other is the old one. The students play sports badminton and table tennis in
            it. Also
            if we
            have any literary function, it always takes place in the new gymnasium.</p>
